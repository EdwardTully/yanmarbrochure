#Yanmar Engine Brochure

This is a react project using router to make a multi page spa for displaying jpg of an old brochure.
In this project I will attempt to make forward and back buttons, in additon to the main table of contents.
The router version is 6, and I have minimum experience with 5, so there is some learning going on. One big thing
I found is it is difficult to display pdf files, so all the ones I had I converted to jpg and used and img element. :(
